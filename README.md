## Description

This project is a web application for loading and visualizing 3D models using Three.js library. It allows users to upload FBX files, which are then displayed in a 3D scene. Additionally, users can export the loaded models in GLTF format.

## Features

- Upload FBX files to visualize 3D models.
- Export loaded models in GLTF format.
- Responsive design for various devices.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/oNavShaHo/helloar
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

4. Open the application in your browser:

## Usage

1. Choose an FBX file by clicking on the "Choose File" button.

## Challenge Faced
- I was unable to any documentation on FBXLoader ,although one youtober luciky gave me hint to 
  check code snippits from example in three.js and after that is was easy.
- Took me 4 hours to decide what will be the correct way of conversion ,how i dealt -tried 
  every possible way using demo projects ,and it finally worked.
